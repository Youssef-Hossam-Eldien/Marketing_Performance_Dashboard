# Marketing Performance & Profitability Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project delivers an end-to-end Business Intelligence solution designed to analyze marketing campaigns, financial performance, and customer behavior. The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources to provide a 360-degree view of business health, transforming raw advertising data into actionable strategic insights.

The primary objective was to optimize ad spend allocation, reduce budget waste, and maximize profitability through data-driven decision-making.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
The dashboard tracks high-impact metrics derived from real-world datasets:
- **Total Revenue:** $529.92K
- **Net Profit:** $423.74K
- **Return on Ad Spend (ROAS):** 4.99x
- **Conversion Rate:** 2.99%
- **Identified Wasted Spend:** $1.74K
- **Returning Customer Rate:** 50%

## Dashboard Features & Insights

### 1. Executive Overview
Provides a high-level financial summary to enable quick assessment of business health.
- Monitors Revenue vs. Ad Spend trends to identify seasonal performance peaks.
- Tracks Profit Margins and total advertising expenditure ($106.18K) in real-time.
- Visualizes profit status distribution (Profit vs. Loss vs. No Sale).

### 2. Marketing Optimization
Focuses on campaign efficiency and budget allocation.
- **Budget Optimization:** Highlights $1.74K in wasted spend, enabling immediate reallocation to high-performing channels.
- **Channel Efficiency:** Compares ROAS across different channels (Social Media, Online, etc.) to determine the most profitable platforms.
- **Heatmap Analysis:** Breakdowns ad performance by day and time to optimize ad scheduling strategies.
- **Cost Metrics:** Tracks Average Cost Per Acquisition (CPA) at $21.69 to ensure acquisition costs remain within targets.

### 3. Customer & Product Intelligence
Deep dives into customer behavior and product performance.
- **Retention Analysis:** Reveals a 50% returning customer rate, validating long-term loyalty strategies.
- **Product Profitability:** Identifies "Deluxe" as the top-selling service category with the highest profit contribution.
- **Ticket Size Distribution:** Segments sales into High, Mid, and Low ticket sizes to tailor marketing messages to specific demographics.
- **Average Order Value (AOV):** Tracks AOV ($167K) to measure revenue per transaction.

## Technical Stack & Methodology

### Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI:** For interactive dashboard creation, bookmarking, and drill-through functionality.
- **Power Query:** For ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes, data cleaning, and preparation.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** For creating complex measures (e.g., dynamic ROAS calculation, Wasted Spend logic, Profit Margins).
- **Excel:** Used as data sources and for initial data exploration.

### Data Modeling
- Implemented a Star Schema architecture to ensure efficient query performance.
- Established relationships between Fact tables (Sales, Ad Spend) and Dimension tables (Date, Customer, Product).

## Business Impact
This project facilitated a shift from reactive reporting to proactive optimization:
1. **Cost Reduction:** Diagnosed and eliminated inefficient ad spend, saving capital.
2. **Revenue Growth:** Scaled high-ROAS campaigns (4.99x) based on performance data.
3. **Strategic Targeting:** Leveraged demographic and behavioral insights to improve customer retention strategies.
